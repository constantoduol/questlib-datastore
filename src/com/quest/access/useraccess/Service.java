/**
 * <p>
 * This file defines a framework for providing services through a server
 * dividing the activities of a server into services splits up the servers work
 * and ensures that the logic of the different services is easily maintained in
 * different class files. When a programmer writes a service class he
 * initializes the service by creating an instance of the service class with the
 * specified details. When the server starts it reads all the services
 * registered for this server into memory and therefore whenever a client
 * requests for any service, the server checks whether the service exists, if it
 * exists the server gets the location of the service class and then invokes the
 * provideService method in the specific service class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Service providing classes must implement the Serviceable interface and
 * provide an implementation for the provideService() method. Services normally
 * have a permanent privilege associated with them and therefore if a user has
 * access to a service it means he has the corresponding permanent privilege,
 * revoking this privilege from the user renders him unable to access the
 * corresponding service. Every client's request to a service runs in a
 * different thread which invokes the specified service and returns the result
 * to the client, this means that service classes should be designed with multi
 * threading in mind since different threads may call a service class at the
 * same time
 * </p>
